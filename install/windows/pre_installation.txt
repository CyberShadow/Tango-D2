WARNING: Changes to be made.

--- The installer will create a backup for DMD's phobos.lib ( named dmd_phobos.lib )  and replace it with a Tango compatible version.

--- The installer will overwrite build.exe if you elect to install it.

To get back to using DigitalMars runtime library (Phobos), simply run the Revert commands found in the Start Menu, or if you have disabled Start Menu creation, run the revert.exe command found in INSTALLDIR\ from the commandline.  


 
Enjoy!
